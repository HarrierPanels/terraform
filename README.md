# Terraform Tasks
The purpose of the tasks is to apply theoretical knowledge in practice and acquire hands-on experience using the tools and technologies presented in the submodule *Infrastructure as code*.
## Environment Requirements
To complete the practical tasks for the Terraform lessons, you need to build a working environment on a local machine using virtualization (e.g., Vagrant) or install Terraform on your laptop/computer.

The architecture of the project you build should include:

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- 2 x EC2 Instances
- 1 x Load Balancer
## Task 1
For this task, you will install Terraform, create a Terraform minimal viable product (MVP), and execute Terraform commands.

**Goals:**
- Install Terraform to your control machine (your laptop).
- Create a folder for your Terraform project and put the main.ts file in it.
- Add information to the **main.tf** file about your cloud provider, Amazon AWS.
- Generate an AWS_ACCESS_KEY and an AWS_SECRET_KEY in your Amazon AWS account.
- Add Amazon AWS credentials to the **main.tf** file or environment variables.
- Initialize and apply the current version of your Terraform project.
