# Terraform Tasks
To complete the practical tasks for the Terraform lessons, you need to build a working environment on a local machine using virtualization (e.g., Vagrant) or install Terraform on your laptop/computer.

The architecture of the project you build should include:

    VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
    2 x EC2 Instances
    1 x Load Balancer
